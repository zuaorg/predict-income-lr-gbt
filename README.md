# predict-income-lr-gbt

Successfully executed a project to predict adult income from a dataset of approximately 48,000 individuals. This involved leveraging features such as education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, and native country to build predictive models (based on your input).
Demonstrated expertise in data preprocessing and feature engineering, including handling missing values, distilling relevant features, and employing one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables  into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
Built and trained two distinct machine learning models, a logistic regression and a gradient-boosted tree, to classify adult income. Achieved optimized model performance through rigorous tuning and evaluation using grid parameter search and 5-fold cross-validation on the training set, focusing on maximizing the areaUnderROC. The models achieved the following prediction results on the unseen testing set: Logistic Regression: AUC-ROC of 0.904, and Gradient-Boosted Tree: AUC-ROC of 0.916.
